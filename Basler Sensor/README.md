There are three versions of the Basler Sensor GUI available here. 
- Basler sensor only
- Basler sensor and motor
- Basler sensor, motor, and ESP32 remote

1. Basler Sensor Only:
   This GUI will allow you to preview the image captured by the sensor, capture images, and take videos depending on the number of frames the user desire. There will be options available to change the exposure time of the sensor and the fps of the saved video as well.
